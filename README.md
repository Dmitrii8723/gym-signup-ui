Important: This project is using parcel modules bulndler

<!-- Step by step guidance:  -->

1. execute `npm install`
2. manually enter this url `http://localhost:1234/sign-up` (p.s. have decided not to create sign-in page)
3. procced with filling out the form (fyi, there are a couple of issues with email validation at the moment.)

fyi, ideally I would prefer using eslint for this project. Also, I haven't configured it yet...
